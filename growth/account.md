# Creating your RevoSurge account

## What is a RevoSurge account?
A RevoSurge account represents your business on the platform. It is the container for:
- Legal company identity

- Users, roles, and permissions
- Products (websites/apps) you want to promote
- Campaigns, analytics, and financial balances

## Prerequisites
Prepare:
- Legal company name
- Registered business address and country
- Main contact name and email

## Create or activate your account
1. **Sign up or accept an invite**
   - Use the sign-up link from your RevoSurge representative, or
   - Accept the invitation email if your company account already exists.

2. **Fill in company details**
   - Company legal name
   - Country of registration
   - Business address
   - Primary contact (name + email)

3. **Accept the online agreement**
   Your click-to-accept acts as a digital signature.
   When accepted, account status becomes eligible to be **Ready** (if mandatory details are complete).

## Add team members and roles
Built-in roles:
- **Admin (Master)**: full access (including user/role management)
- **Ad Executive**: manage products, campaigns, creatives, and reports (assigned scope)
