# Getting started with RevoSurge

This guide walks you through the minimum steps to launch your first AdWave campaign with measurable results.

## Step 1 — Create your account
- Provide legal company information
- Accept the online agreement (required for account to become **Ready**)
- Add teammates and assign roles

→ See: [**Growth → Creating your RevoSurge account**](/growth/account.md)

## Step 2 — Fund your shared wallet
AdWave and DataPulse share the same account-level wallet.

→ See: [**Growth → Funding your shared wallet**](/growth/funding-wallet.md)

## Step 3 — Create a Product
A **Product** is the destination you promote (a website domain or an app).  
Each Product has **one tracker data source**.

## Step 4 — Install and verify tracking
Install the tracker on your site/app and validate:
- Tracker status = Active / In-use
- Key event status = Live

→ See: [**Tracking → Web tracker install**](/tracking/web-tracker-install) and [**Tracking → Events**](/tracking/events.md)

## Step 5 — Launch a campaign in AdWave
Use the guided flow to create Campaign + Ad Group + Ad in one workflow.

→ See: [**AdWave → Guided campaign setup**](/adwave/guided-campaign-setup.md)
