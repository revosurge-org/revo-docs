## What is an audience segment?
An **Audience Segment** is a saved definition that groups users who match specific conditions (e.g., users who clicked an ad, visited a site, etc.).

Segments are typically used to:
- Retarget engaged users
- Exclude low-quality users
- Create interest-based or behavior-based audiences

## Where segments are used
Segments can be used in campaign targeting (Step 3 in [**AdWave → Guided campaign setup**](/en/adwave/guided-campaign-setup)) when the UI allows selecting audience labels/segments.
