**For:** Developers, Technical integrators, BI engineers

RevoSurge APIs let you automate workflows and integrate reporting and events into your own systems.

## In this article

## What you can do with the API
Common use cases include:
- Send **Server-to-Server (S2S) events**
- Pull reporting aggregates (imps, clicks, spend, conversions) where available
- Manage keys and access (depending on console capabilities)

## Typical integration patterns
- Daily export to data warehouse for reporting
- Server events for deposits/transactions
- Building user segments (if/when supported by API)

## Before you start
You will need:
- An API key (see **API Key**)
