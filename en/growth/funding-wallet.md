# Funding your shared wallet

**Audience:** Admin/Master, Finance

## Shared wallet concept
AdWave and DataPulse share the same **account-level wallet**.  
You deposit once and use the same balance across services.

## Deposit funds
1. Go to **Billing → Deposit funds**
2. Choose a payment method (availability depends on region), such as:
   - Credit card
   - Bank transfer
   - Crypto wallet
3. Enter the deposit amount (respect any minimum deposit requirement)
4. Confirm any **non-refundable** disclaimer (if shown)
5. Complete the payment flow

## Verify deposit success
After payment:
- Your **Account balance** should update
- A **Deposit** record should appear in **Transaction history**

## Recommended operational practice
- Finance reviews wallet balance daily
- If campaigns are planned, keep buffer balance to avoid delivery pauses due to insufficient funds
