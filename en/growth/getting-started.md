## 1) Account structure & roles
A RevoSurge account represents your business on the platform. It includes:
- Company identity (legal name, region)
- Users, roles, and permissions
- Billing and wallet balance
- Products (websites/apps)
- Campaigns and reporting

**Common roles (example):**
- **Admin / Master:** Full access, user management, billing visibility  
- **Ad Executive:** Campaign and creative management  
- **Data Analyst:** Reporting and measurement (where available)  
- **Finance:** Balance, invoices, transaction records  

> Tip: Keep at least one Admin/Master user active to avoid access lockouts.

## 2) Funding & wallet basics
RevoSurge uses an **account-level shared wallet**.  
Before running campaigns, confirm:
- Wallet has enough balance for planned spend
- Your finance team understands deposit flow and transaction records

What you should be able to see:
- Current balance (wallet)
- Transaction history / deposit records
- Campaign spend totals (in AdWave)

## 3) Product setup (high-level)
A **Product** is the site/app you promote.  
At minimum you need:
- A product selected in AdWave
- Tracking readiness (see [**Tracking → Overview**](/en/tracking/overview))

## 4) Launching your first pilot (recommended checklist)
Before going live:
- ✅ Product selected  
- ✅ Target event selected (must be available/live depending on current rules)  
- ✅ Creative uploaded & reviewed  
- ✅ Geo targeting set  
- ✅ Daily budget & CPM/bid set  
- ✅ Monitoring plan agreed (who reviews spend, performance, quality)
