# RevoSurge

RevoSurge is a unified platform that helps advertisers **run performance campaigns (AdWave)** and **measure outcomes using first-party + ad-side data (DataPulse / tracking layer)**.

## Who this is for
- **Admins / Account owners**: manage account, wallet, members, and permissions
- **UA / Growth teams**: launch and optimize campaigns in AdWave
- **Developers / BI teams**: install tracking, validate events, and integrate via API

## The RevoSurge hierarchy
RevoSurge follows a clear data hierarchy:

**Account → Product → Campaign → Ad Group → Ad**

- **Account**: your company entity, wallet, members, permissions
- **Product**: a website domain or app destination you want to promote; it owns one tracker data source
- **Campaign / Ad Group / Ad**: delivery, targeting, creatives, and performance settings

## Getting started checklist
1. Create or activate your account (agreement + company profile)
2. Invite teammates and set roles
3. Fund your shared wallet (for AdWave/DataPulse usage)
4. Create a Product (domain / app)
5. Install the tracker and validate events
6. Launch a campaign using Guided Campaign Setup in AdWave
