## What RevoSurge includes
- **AdWave (DSP):** Create and run campaigns across multiple SSPs via RTB.  
- **DataPulse (Analytics):** View downstream outcomes and reporting (availability depends on your current rollout).  
- **Tracking:** Web tracker and Server-to-Server (S2S) events to connect ad exposure to onsite/onsystem outcomes.  

## Key concepts
- **Account:** Your company container in RevoSurge (users, billing, products, campaigns).  
- **Wallet:** Shared balance used by AdWave and (when enabled) DataPulse-related services.  
- **Product:** A website/app destination you promote. Campaigns run against a selected product.  
- **Event:** A tracked action you want to optimize/measure (e.g., Register, Deposit).  

## Typical workflow
1) Create/activate an account and add teammates  
2) Create a product (site/app)  
3) Ensure tracking is ready (Web tracker / S2S events)  
4) Create a campaign in AdWave (guided setup)  
5) Monitor pilot performance & traffic quality  
6) Scale budgets, refine targeting, and apply kill rules where needed
