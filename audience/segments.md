# Working with audience segments

Audience Segments help you target specific user groups more precisely.

## Audience Segment dashboard
A central hub to manage segments:
- Name
- In-use status (active/inactive)
- Estimated size (updated daily)
- Creation date
- Source (User-defined / Algorithmic)
- Actions: Edit, Delete, Use, View details

## Segment builder (manual)
- Build rules using attributes (demographic / behavioral / contextual)
- Support AND / OR logic
- Live size preview
- Name + optional description required

## Algorithmic segments (recommended)
The platform can recommend segments (e.g., “High-value users”, “Recent visitors”) based on 1st/2nd party data and behavior.

## Use segments in AdWave
When setting up AdWave targeting:
- Select one or more audience labels/segments (optional)
- Multiple labels produce an **intersection** audience
